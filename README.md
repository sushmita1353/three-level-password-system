# Three-Level-Password-System
## Overview

This project implements a three-level authentication system designed to provide robust security against unauthorized access. The system combines traditional password authentication with graphical and behavioral authentication mechanisms, offering a multi-layered defense.

## Features

- **Level 1: Textual Password Authentication** - Users must provide a valid username and password. The password is securely hashed using SHA-256.
- **Level 2: Graphical Password Authentication** - Users are required to select a sequence of graphical elements in the correct order.
- **Level 3: Behavioral Authentication** - (Optional) Could include methods such as typing patterns or other behavior-based checks.
